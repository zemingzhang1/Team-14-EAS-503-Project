# README

Welcome to our project! This README file will give you instructions on how to run our code.

## Requirements

Before you get started, you will need to make sure you have the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The folder uploaded in UB box, which contains all the necessary contents

## Running the code

To run the code, first you will need to change the PATH variable in the file `database_main.py`, line 14, to the location of the folder uploaded in UB box. 

Once that is done, you can run the notebook `EDA.ipynb` and the code should execute correctly.

Thank you for using our project! If you have any questions or issues, please do not hesitate to contact us.
